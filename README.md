# Caesar Cipher Project

## Description

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. This project was developed as part of an internship task at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext using a specified shift value.
- Decrypts ciphertext using the same shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).

## Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CaesarCipherProject.git
    cd CaesarCipherProject
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The script is compatible with Python 3.

3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the text you wish to encrypt and the shift value.

## Example

Here is an example interaction with the script:

Enter the text to encrypt: My name is Musa Ceesay
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted text: Pb qdph lv Pxvd Fhhvdb
Decrypted text: My name is Musa Ceesay
